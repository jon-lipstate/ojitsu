    "Loads the value from the top of the stack to the location specified with the destination operand (or explicit opcode) and then increments the stack pointer. The destination operand can be a general-purpose register, memory location, or segment register.",
    "Address and operand sizes are determined and used as follows:",
    "The operand size (16, 32, or 64 bits) determines the amount by which the stack pointer is incremented (2, 4 or 8).",
    "The stack-address size determines the width of the stack pointer when reading from the stack in memory and when incrementing the stack pointer. (As stated above, the amount by which the stack pointer is incremented is determined by the operand size.)",
    "If the destination operand is one of the segment registers DS, ES, FS, GS, or SS, the value loaded into the register must be a valid segment selector. In protected mode, popping a segment selector into a segment register automatically causes the descriptor information associated with that segment selector to be loaded into the hidden (shadow) part of the segment register and causes the selector and the descriptor information to be validated (see the \u201cOperation\u201d section below).",
    "A NULL value (0000-0003) may be popped into the DS, ES, FS, or GS register without causing a general protection fault. However, any subsequent attempt to reference a segment whose corresponding segment register is loaded with a NULL value causes a general protection exception (#GP). In this situation, no memory reference occurs and the saved value of the segment register is NULL.",
    "The POP instruction cannot pop a value into the CS register. To load the CS register from the stack, use the RET instruction.",
    "If the ESP register is used as a base register for addressing a destination operand in memory, the POP instruction computes the effective address of the operand after it increments the ESP register. For the case of a 16-bit stack where ESP wraps to 0H as a result of the POP instruction, the resulting location of the memory write is processor-family-specific.",
    "The POP ESP instruction increments the stack pointer (ESP) before data at the old top of stack is written into the destination.",
    "Loading the SS register with a POP instruction suppresses or inhibits some debug exceptions and inhibits interrupts on the following instruction boundary. (The inhibition ends after delivery of an exception or the execution of the next instruction.) This behavior allows a stack pointer to be loaded into the ESP register with the next instruction (POP ESP) before an event can be delivered. See Section 6.8.3, \u201cMasking Exceptions and Interrupts When Switching Stacks,\u201d inIntel\u00ae 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer\u2019s Manual, Volume 3A.Intel recommends that software use the LSS instruction to load the SS register and ESP together.",
    "In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). When in 64-bit mode, POPs using 32-bit operands are not encodable and POPs to DS, ES, SS are not valid. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits."
