    "The ID flag (bit 21) in the EFLAGS register indicates support for the CPUID instruction. If a software procedure can set and clear this flag, the processor executing the procedure supports the CPUID instruction. This instruction operates the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.",
    "CPUID returns processor identification and feature information in the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers.1The instruction\u2019s output is dependent on the contents of the EAX register upon execution (in some cases, ECX as well). For example, the following pseudocode loads EAX with 00H and causes CPUID to return a Maximum Return Value and the Vendor Identification String in the appropriate registers:",

    "Table 3-8shows information returned, depending on the initial value loaded into the EAX register.",
    "Two types of information are returned: basic and extended function information. If a value entered for CPUID.EAX is higher than the maximum input value for basic or extended function for that processor then the data for the highest basic information leaf is returned. For example, using some Intel processors, the following is true:",
    "CPUID.EAX = 05H (* Returns MONITOR/MWAIT leaf. *)",
